You are provided data for sales of Progresso soup in the U.S. The data are derived from approximately 2000 supermarkets across the country and span 6 years (2001-06). 
Create a dummy variable for “Winter” months defined as Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan & Feb. Use the “Month” variable to create this.
Compute the “Market Share” for Progresso (as percentage of total sales) in the Winter vs. non-Winter months using the variable created in (1).
Develop a linear regression model to predict Progresso sales. Explain the results of the regression model (model strength, variable importance, relationship between the predictor and dependent variables). Use 1st tab in file.
Predict Progresso Sales for stores listed in the “Predict” tab.
